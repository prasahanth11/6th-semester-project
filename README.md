Project Description: Airline Reservation System in C++
Introduction
The Airline Reservation System is a software application developed in C++ that facilitates the booking and management of airline tickets. The system allows users to search for flights, book tickets, manage reservations, and view flight details. This project aims to simulate the core functionalities of an airline reservation system and provide a practical example of object-oriented programming in C++.

Objectives
To develop a functional and user-friendly airline reservation system.
To implement core features such as flight search, ticket booking, reservation management, and flight information display.
To demonstrate the use of object-oriented principles in C++.
To ensure data integrity and consistency in the reservation process.
Features
Flight Search: Allows users to search for available flights based on criteria such as origin, destination, and date.
Ticket Booking: Enables users to book tickets for selected flights, specifying passenger details and seat preferences.
Reservation Management: Provides functionality to view, modify, and cancel reservations.
Flight Information: Displays detailed information about flights, including departure and arrival times, flight duration, and available seats.
User Authentication: Ensures secure access to the system for both passengers and administrators.
Administrative Functions: Allows administrators to manage flight schedules, add or remove flights, and monitor system usage.
System Design
The Airline Reservation System is designed using object-oriented principles, with a focus on modularity, encapsulation, and reusability. The main components of the system include:

Classes and Objects:

Flight: Represents a flight with attributes like flight number, origin, destination, departure time, arrival time, and available seats.
Passenger: Represents a passenger with attributes such as name, age, gender, and contact information.
Reservation: Represents a reservation with details such as booking ID, passenger information, flight details, and seat number.
User: Represents a system user, with subclasses for Passenger and Admin.
Data Structures:

Use of arrays, vectors, or linked lists to store and manage flight and reservation data.
File Handling:

Reading from and writing to files for persistent storage of flight schedules and reservations.
Error Handling:

Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to ensure system stability and data integrity.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Development Environment: Any standard C++ IDE such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
Data Storage: File handling for storing and retrieving data (e.g., flights.txt, reservations.txt).
Example Use Case
User Login: The user logs into the system using their credentials.
Search Flights: The user searches for flights by entering the origin, destination, and date.
Book Ticket: The user selects a flight, enters passenger details, and confirms the booking.
View Reservation: The user can view their reservation details, including the booking ID and flight information.
Admin Functions: The admin can log in to add new flights, update existing flights, or remove flights from the schedule.
Conclusion
The Airline Reservation System in C++ provides a comprehensive solution for managing airline bookings and reservations. By implementing this project, students can gain hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, data management, and file handling in C++. The system's modular design ensures ease of maintenance and scalability, making it a valuable addition to any software development portfolio.
